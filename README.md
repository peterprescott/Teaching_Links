## Introduction

In this repo we have aimed to provide links to useful teaching resources for teaching Geographic / Spatial Data Science, GIS and Statistics.

With the spread of COVID-19 and the ongoing international response efforts, it is looking like a lot of the academic community will be delivering teaching remotely and online. This might be a problem for some. As such, we have decided to create a living document containing useful teaching resources. Some of these are from the lab, and others are from people who we have reached out to while compiling this.

We do not claim that any of the resources are fully fledged online courses, or that these are a comprehensive list of what is out there, but we think that these might be helpful to the community to list and share.

**If you have anything that you think is useful then send us a tweet @geodatascience or issue a PR to this repository!**

### Automating GIS processes

Teaches you how to do different GIS-related tasks in the Python programming language. Each lesson is a tutorial with specific topic(s) where the aim is to learn how to solve common GIS-related problems and tasks using Python tools. We are using only publicly available data which can be used and downloaded by anyone anywhere. We also provide a computing environment which allows you to instantly start programming and trying out the materials yourself, directly in your browser (no installations needed). Also part of the forthcoming book *[Introduction to Python for Geographic Data Analysis](https://pythongis.org/)*.

### Data, Evidence, and Communication for the Public Good
This course provides you with a toolkit for telling stories with urban data. It will introduce basic code, stats, and reasoning with evidence. The course takes a computational social science approach to working with data. It uses Python and Jupyter notebooks to introduce coding and statistical methods that students can reproduce and experiment with in real-time in the classroom. We start the semester with the basics of coding, then move on to data loading and analysis, then on to basic statistics, then hypotheses and the scientific method, and finally a critical assessment of smart cities and urban informatics.

### Emerging Topics in GIScience: Geographical Computing

Recent years have seen the (re)emergence of programmatic approaches to geographical information science and the de-emphasis of established desktop 'GIS' packages, both in research settings and in the commercial world. This class introduces the Python programming language and the Python geospatial ecosystem to prepare students for conducting research in this new context.
